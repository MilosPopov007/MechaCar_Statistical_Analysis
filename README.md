# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Using R language and environment for statistical computing review of MechaCar prototypes

AutosRUs is a car manufacturing commpany that is finally realizing that their decision making process could be moved into the 21st century.<br> The Data Analytics Team is in charge of performing retrospective analysis of historical data, analytical verification and validation of current automotive specifications and study design of future product testing.<br> The AutosRUs executive team recognizes that the most successful automobile launches utilize data analytics in every decision making process.<br>

AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress.<br> AutosRUs’ upper management has called on me and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

We will use R programming language in this Data Analysis.<br> R has solidified itself in academia and industry as one of the go-to programming languages for statistical modelling and hypothesis testing.<br> In recent years, R developers have extended R's capabilities to generate machine learning algorithms and other advanced models to ensure that R can be used in every stage of data analytics.<br>

In this Data Analysis me and the data analytics team will do the following:
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers
